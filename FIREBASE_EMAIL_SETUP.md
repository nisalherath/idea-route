# Firebase Console Configuration for Custom Password Reset UI

Your app already has a beautiful custom password reset page that matches your UI/UX design. The issue is that Firebase is redirecting users to their generic hosted page instead of your custom page.

## ðŸ”§ Quick Fix: Configure Firebase Console

### Step 1: Access Firebase Console
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Authentication** â†’ **Templates**

### Step 2: Configure Password Reset Template
1. Click on **"Password reset"** template
2. Click **"Edit template"**
3. In the **"Action URL"** field, change from:
   ```
   https://your-project.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/action
   ```
   To:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/reset-password
   ```
   (For development, use your production domain for production)

### Step 3: Save Changes
1. Click **"Save"** to apply changes
2. Test the password reset flow

## ðŸŽ¨ Your Custom UI Features

Your existing password reset page (`/src/app/reset-password/page.tsx`) already includes:

âœ… **Consistent Styling** - Uses the same Auth.module.css as your login page
âœ… **Gradient Background** - Matches your app's purple gradient theme  
âœ… **Loading States** - Professional loading spinners during verification
âœ… **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error messages for all scenarios
âœ… **Security** - Proper action code verification and validation
âœ… **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first design that matches your auth page
âœ… **Password Validation** - Real-time password strength checking
âœ… **User Experience** - Show/hide password toggles and clear feedback

## ðŸš€ Current Flow vs New Flow

### Current Flow (Generic Firebase UI):
```
User clicks reset link â†’ Firebase generic page â†’ Inconsistent UI
```

### After Configuration (Your Custom UI):
```
User clicks reset link â†’ Your custom page â†’ Consistent UI/UX
```

## ðŸ”’ Environment Variables

Make sure you have this set in your `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

For production:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

## ðŸ“± Responsive Design Preview

Your custom reset page includes:
- **Mobile**: Clean card layout with touch-friendly inputs
- **Tablet**: Optimized spacing and typography
- **Desktop**: Centered design with beautiful gradients

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Approach?

1. **Consistent Branding** - Users stay within your app's design system
2. **Better UX** - No jarring transitions to external pages
3. **Custom Features** - You can add your own validation, analytics, etc.
4. **Security** - Full control over the reset process
5. **Professional** - Matches modern app standards

## ðŸ”§ Alternative: Custom Email Templates

If you want even more control, you can also customize the email templates in Firebase Console:

1. Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Templates**
2. Click **"Password reset"** 
3. Edit the email content to match your brand
4. Customize the subject line and message

Your app is already set up perfectly - you just need to point Firebase to use your custom page instead of their generic one!
